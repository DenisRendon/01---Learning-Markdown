### 01 - Learning Markdown

1. Markdown does not seem to complicated compared to other languages. You have the ability to quickly create readmes. It reminds me of NotePad, it doesnt have everything but it has enough editing tools to create what you need quickly.
2. From a quick read and glance over a cheat sheet I like the ability to quickly create some **formating** options.
3. One thing I have been looking for is to see if they have a highlighting option but underline works
4. Overall it has alot of basic options that you can take 20mins and youll feel confident in it
